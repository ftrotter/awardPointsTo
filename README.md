An Application to use ChatGPT as a front-end for a "award point to this house/team" interface. 

Obvious Homage (while being different enough to be clearly Fair Use) to the Xarry Xotter franshice!! 
This is not that though! 

Important differences: 

* Primary mode supports working together to get the total as high as possible. Houses/Teams are not strictly in competition. 
* Track points based on person, across houses/teams, as opposed to having persons associated with one and only one team. 
* Teams/Houses are designed get points when an indivdual does something that supports the house ideals, or lose points for violating the house ideals. 
* Obviously you can setup your houses to map to Xogwarts.. but you can also do Xedi vs Xith or model out a point system for whatever your favorite mythical world
